    "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that views software as a collection of independent, interacting objects. Each object combines data and behavior, allowing it to naturally represent both real-world entities and abstract concepts. With its core pillars of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, OOP facilitates the design of modular, extensible, and reusable systems. This approach also paves the way for scalable architectures, efficient team collaboration, and the integration of advanced concepts such as object relationships, metaclasses, and design patterns to elegantly solve complex problems."

    "Abstraction is the technique of hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionality to the user.\n",

    "Abstraction is a way of viewing an object only from the perspective that matters to us, while hiding unnecessary details. In object-oriented programming, this means simply defining what an object can do without explaining how it does it. This way, we can work with clear and simple concepts, while leaving the technical details to the parts responsible for implementing them.\n",

    "Think of a vehicle. We know it can run, stop, and turn, but we don't need to think about how the engine works every time we want to use it.

    "2. Aggregation – An object is composed of other objects, but the constituent objects can stand alone (e.g., a team consists of players).\n",
    "3. Composition – An object is composed of other objects that cannot stand alone (e.g., a house has a door).\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP-based systems, objects rarely stand alone. Most are interconnected and work together to achieve a specific goal. Relationships between objects describe how one object interacts with or depends on another object. These relationships can be loose, where objects only know each other to exchange information, or tight, where one object is completely part of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an online store application, a Customer object might have a relationship with an Order, and an Order might have a relationship with a Product. Some relationships are simply mutually exclusive, such as a customer ordering a specific product, while others are stronger, such as an order not existing without its product list.

    "In an association, a relationship is formed between two objects that know each other but can still exist independently. The `Book` class has a reference to the `Author` object, allowing it to display complete information about the title and author. However, both `Book` and `Author` can exist without being completely dependent on each other.\n",

    "In an aggregation, the relationship is loosely coupled. The `Team` class maintains a list of `Players` that can be added or removed at any time. `Players` are not permanently attached to the `team`—they can move to another `team` or remain even if the `team` is disbanded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, composition demonstrates a much tighter, interdependent relationship. In the `House` class, the `Door` object is created directly within the constructor and becomes an integral part of the house. If the house is deleted, the door disappears as well. This relationship demonstrates the inseparable, full ownership between the parent object and its sub-objects.\n",

    "# Metaclass\n",
    "A metaclass is a 'class of a class'. If an object is created from a class, then the class is created from a metaclass.\n",
    "A metaclass allows us to control the creation of a class, such as automatically modifying attributes or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A metaclass is a \"class of a class,\" a mechanism that governs how a class itself is created. While a class is used to create an object, a metaclass is used to create and manage the behavior of the class itself. With a metaclass, we can control the class creation process, automatically modify attributes or methods, and even enforce certain rules that all derived classes must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a class as a cookie cutter, and an object as the resulting cookie. A metaclass is the cookie cutter used to create the cookie cutter itself. By modifying the cookie cutter at the metaclass level, we indirectly affect all the classes it generates. This concept is rarely used at the beginner level, but it is very useful for building frameworks, implementing automatic validation, or creating dynamic behavior in complex systems."

    "## Case Study: Creating a Class with Automatic Validation\n",
    "This example demonstrates the use of a metaclass to control automatic class creation. The metaclass `UpperAttrMetaclass` is defined to check all attributes a class has at the time of class creation. If an attribute name does not begin with `__` (which typically indicates a Python-specific attribute), the metaclass capitalizes the attribute name.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class `MyClass` that uses this metaclass will automatically have the attribute `FOO` instead of `foo`, without the developer having to manually capitalize it. This process occurs before any object of the class is created, during the class definition stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is very useful for enforcing naming rules or standards throughout code, ensuring consistency, and preventing errors caused by mis-written attributes. With metaclasses, validation and transformation can be performed at the structural level, rather than just at object execution, providing very fine-grained control over class design."
