# Simulates the probability that three random segments (with total length = 1) can form a triangle.
# Method: randomly select two cut points along a stick of length 1.
# The three segments are: from 0 to point1, from point1 to point2, and from point2 to 1.
# Triangle condition for sides a, b, c:
# The sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side:
# a + b > c
# a + c > b
# b + c > a
# Or logically: sum of all sides - max_side > max_side â†’ triangle is valid
