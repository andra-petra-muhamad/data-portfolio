    "## Concurrency\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "Concurrency is the ability of a program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously (alternately and very quickly), although they don't necessarily run at the same time.\n",
    "**Analogy**\n",
    "Imagine a chef cooking three dishes. He or she switches between tasks rapidly: waiting for the water to boil, then chopping vegetables, then stirring the soup. They aren't done simultaneously, but they all run.\n",
    "**Technical**\n",
    "* Typically uses a single-core CPU\n",
    "* Assisted by threading, asynchronous I/O, or coroutines (such as async and await in Python)\n",
    "* Suitable for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading files, web scraping, database queries)\n",
    "## Parallelism\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "Parallelism is the ability to execute multiple tasks completely concurrently, at the same time, using multiple CPU cores or multiple processors.\n",

    "Imagine three chefs in three kitchens, each cooking a single dish. All tasks run in parallel and simultaneously.\n",

    "* Requires a multi-core CPU\n",

The square function calculates the square of a number in a data list containing the numbers 0 through 99, with a one-second pause between each processing step to simulate a time-consuming process. Because the number of threads is 100 equals the number of elements in the data, all tasks can be processed simultaneously, so the total execution time is close to the execution time of a single function (about 1 second), rather than 100 seconds as with sequential processing. This approach demonstrates the power of concurrency in maximizing thread utilization for increased efficiency, although in practice, too many threads can put stress on the system depending on load and resources."

    "## Example 2: Concurrent Execution with ProcessPoolExecutor\n",
    "This code uses parallelism through ProcessPoolExecutor to execute a square function in parallel using separate processes. The square function will square each element in the data list, but with a 1-second delay to simulate a demanding task. Because max_workers=3, only three processes are running concurrently. The rest will wait until a process completes. This makes execution faster than sequential execution, but is still limited by the number of available workers. Because it uses processes (rather than threads), this approach is suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require higher performance and can efficiently utilize multiple CPU cores. The final result of the square calculation of all elements is displayed after all processes have completed."

    "Experiments showed that downloading images one by one (sequentially) took the longest time, at around 9.45 seconds. Using ThreadPoolExecutor significantly reduced the time to around 3.61 seconds because it allows multiple downloads to run concurrently within a single process using multiple threads. Interestingly, ProcessPoolExecutor recorded the fastest time, at around 0.45 seconds, although it is generally better suited for CPU-intensive tasks (rather than I/O tasks like requests). However, these results can be inconsistent because parallel processing can be affected by cache, network, or the system environment.\n",
