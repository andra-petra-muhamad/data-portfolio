/*
A company is rapidly growing with an increasing number of employees 
across various departments such as IT, HR, Finance, and Marketing. 
The company needs a database system to record employee information 
as well as department structure so that HR management becomes more efficient.

Therefore, the `company_employees` database is built with the main structure:
1. `departments` table to store department data (ID and department name).
2. `employee` table to store employee data (name, birth date, hire date, salary, and department).

With this system, the company can:
- View the list of employees along with their departments.
- Manage salary information and hiring dates.
- See the distribution of employees in each department.
- Assist HR analysis, such as finding the highest-paid employee or the average salary per department.
